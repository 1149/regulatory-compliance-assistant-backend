> **An intelligent FastAPI backend that automates regulatory document processing, compliance analysis, and provides AI-powered insights for enterprise compliance workflows.**

## Overview

A sophisticated backend system leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to transform how organizations handle regulatory compliance. Built with modern Python frameworks and enterprise-grade architecture patterns.

## Key Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Document Analysis** - Advanced NLP with dual AI engine support (Google Gemini + Local Ollama)
- **Intelligent Processing** - Automated PDF parsing, entity extraction, and compliance clause identification
- **RAG-Based Q&A** - Contextual question-answering system with document attribution
- **Semantic Search** - Advanced document search and categorization
- **Entity Recognition** - Automated extraction of people, organizations, dates, and compliance terms
- **Modular Architecture** - Scalable, maintainable design with clean separation of concerns

## Technical Stack

**Backend Framework:** FastAPI with async support  
**AI/ML:** Google Gemini AI, Ollama, SpaCy NLP  
**Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL/SQLite support  
**Document Processing:** Custom PDF parsing with advanced text normalization  
**Architecture:** RESTful API with modular route organization  

## API Overview

### Core Endpoints
- **Document Management** - Upload, process, retrieve, and manage regulatory documents
- **AI Analysis** - Entity extraction, compliance analysis, and policy review
- **Intelligent Q&A** - RAG-powered question answering with context awareness

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "document_id": 123,
  "entities": {
    "organizations": ["TechSolutions Inc.", "GDPR Authority"],
    "compliance_terms": ["data retention", "privacy policy"],
    "dates": ["2024-09-01", "2025-09-01"]
  },
  "compliance_score": 94.5,
  "key_requirements": ["encryption", "access control", "audit trails"]
}
```
